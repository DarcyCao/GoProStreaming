Streaming with the GoPro Hero4 made easy

Most of this code was written by KonradIT, see https://github.com/KonradIT/goprowifihack for more.
I simply added all the necessary steps together so you can just fire this script up and be done with it.

Dependencies:

- Python
- ffmpeg (for ffplay)
- GoPro Hero 4

1. Connect your desktop or laptop to your GoPro via WIFI.
2. Run this script.

That's all! When done, press CTRL+C to quit this application.
